# IPL-win-Predictor
IPL Win Predictor
Overview
The IPL Win Predictor is a machine learning project that forecasts the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using logistic regression. By analyzing historical match data and ball-by-ball delivery data, this model aims to provide accurate predictions of match results.

Features
Predicts the winner of IPL matches using logistic regression.
Utilizes historical match results and detailed ball-by-ball delivery data.
Provides insights into model performance and prediction accuracy.
Datasets
match.csv
Contains historical data of IPL matches for the past 8 years.
Includes details such as match date, team names, match result, and winner.
deliveries.csv
Contains ball-by-ball data for every delivery in the IPL matches.
Includes details such as over number, ball number, runs scored, and extras.
Getting Started
To get started with the IPL Win Predictor, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-win-predictor.git
cd ipl-win-predictor
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Download the datasets:

match.csv containing historical match data.
deliveries.csv containing ball-by-ball delivery data.
Place both files in the data/ directory.

Training the Model
To train the logistic regression model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will load the data from match.csv and deliveries.csv, preprocess it, train the logistic regression model, and save the trained model to a file.

Making Predictions
To make predictions for new matches, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --match_data <path_to_new_match_data>
Replace <path_to_new_match_data> with the path to the new match data file in CSV format.
